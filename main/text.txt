We have a request from a customer who wants to build a static web application that simulates a calculator like an Abacus Calculator but with a different shape and different type of calculation and he named it TALMAS like (UCMAS).
the project description is:
"a calculating instrument software simulator that uses beads that slide along a series of rods set in a frame.  Users manipulate the beads to perform calculations, Users could click or drag on the beads to move them up and down on the rods, simulating the physical manipulation"
Based on the meeting  We decided that the customer requirements are:
Mobile responsive 
Drawing Objects
Draggable objects with touch screens and mouse
Auto Calculations
Login Page ( notes that the authentication is not secure enough because we don't work in the backend server)
Code Generator (note: to generate a code each time anyone login)
Simple frontend design

The developers team met and agreed that the project needs 20 working hours and delivered within three days
In our company, we calculate the working hours with 20$ per hour 
A customer requested another project quotation, we will give him a 25% offer in total of both if he decides to make the two projects at the same time
We will host the project in our free host and domain for a maximum of 2 months until his host and domain are ready to host the project.
Because the project is small we will not take a downpayment and we will take all the fees after finishing it 
We will guarantee  free bugs for 3 months and after that, we will  fix bugs according to it and will charge per hour 
If the customer needs to add a new feature (not in this quotation) this will cost him another fee
